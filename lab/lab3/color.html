    <h4>The key to efficient and flexible edge computing</h4>
    <p id="para" onmouseover="mouseOver()" onmouseout="mouseOut()">Researchers have designed a tunable physical reservoir 
        device based on the dielectric relaxation at an electrode-ionic liquid interface. Physical reservoir
        computing (PRC), which relies on the transient response of physical systems, is an attractive machine learning
        framework that can perform high-speed processing of time-series signals at low power.</p>
    <h4>Hybrid quantum bit based on topological insulators</h4>
    <p id="paraG" onmouseover="mouseOverGreen()" onmouseout="mouseOutGreen()">With their superior properties, topological qubits could help 
        achieve a breakthrough in the development of a quantum computer designed for universal applications. So far, no one has yet
        succeeded in unambiguously demonstrating a quantum bit, or qubit for short, of this kind in a lab. Scientists have now 
        succeeded in integrating a topological insulator into a conventional superconducting qubit.</p>
    <h4>An easier way to teach robots new skills</h4>
    <p id="paraB" onmouseover="mouseOverBlue()" onmouseout="mouseOutBlue()">Researchers have developed a technique that enables a robot to learn a new pick-and-place task with only a handful of human 
        demonstrations. This could allow a human to reprogram a robot to grasp never-before-seen objects, presented in random poses, 
        in about 15 minutes.</p>
